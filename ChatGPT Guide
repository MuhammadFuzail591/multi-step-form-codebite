Let's walk through a process that will help you understand and build the functionality step by step. I won’t give you a complete “copy-paste” solution but instead guide you so that you can grow your skills.

### **Step 1. Understand the Current Behavior**

- **Observation:**  
  You have a `CurriculumItem` function that returns some buttons, but you’re calling it like this:  
  ```jsx
  <Button onClick={() => CurriculumItem(section.id)}>
    <Plus /> Curriculum Item
  </Button>
  ```
  **Question to Consider:**  
  - What happens when you call a function inside an `onClick` like that?  
  - Does it actually render the returned JSX or is it just executing the function without affecting the main component’s render?

- **Takeaway:**  
  In React, if you want to show a new UI element (like a set of buttons), you need to control it through state rather than directly calling a function that returns JSX.

---

### **Step 2. Introduce State for UI Toggle**

- **Goal:**  
  You want to show the “choose item type” UI only when the user clicks the **Curriculum Item** button.

- **Plan:**  
  - Add a new property (for example, `isAddingItem`) to your section objects.
  - When the user clicks the **Curriculum Item** button, update that section’s state to set `isAddingItem: true`.

- **Questions to Ask Yourself:**  
  - How can I update only one section’s state when the button is clicked?
  - How can I then use that flag to conditionally render the UI for choosing the item type?

---

### **Step 3. Update the Render Logic**

- **For the Section:**  
  In your JSX where you render each section, do something like:
  
  1. **If the section is still being edited (isEditing is true):**  
     - Show the input and Save button.
  2. **If the section is not being edited (isEditing is false):**  
     - Show the section title.
     - Show a button that toggles the new state (e.g., set `isAddingItem` to `true`).

- **Conditional Rendering:**  
  - When `isAddingItem` is true, render the UI (a set of buttons for “Lecture,” “Quiz,” “Assignment”).
  - Otherwise, just show the **Curriculum Item** button.

- **Hint:**  
  You can write a helper function (or directly inline in JSX) that checks `section.isAddingItem` and renders the appropriate UI.

---

### **Step 4. Implement the “Choose Item Type” UI**

- **When a User Clicks a Type Button:**  
  - Call your `addCurriculumItem` function with the section id and chosen type.
  - Immediately toggle off the `isAddingItem` flag so that the selection UI disappears.

- **Guiding Question:**  
  - How can you update the state for that specific section so that you “hide” the type selection UI once an item is added?

---

### **Step 5. Build the Item Editing UI**

- **For Each Curriculum Item:**  
  - Check if `item.isEditingItem` is `true`. If so, render an input (and other fields you might add later for different item types).
  - When the user finishes editing (for example, by clicking an “Add” or “Save” button), update the state to set `isEditingItem` to `false`.

- **Extra Thought:**  
  - Later on, you might want to extend the editing UI to render different elements based on `item.itemType` (for example, showing a file drop area for lectures, different inputs for quizzes, etc.).

- **Question:**  
  - What additional fields or components might you need for different item types?

---

### **Step 6. Debugging and Testing**

- **Use `console.log`:**  
  Insert temporary `console.log` statements inside your state-updating functions (or render functions) to verify that the state is updated as expected.

- **Test Each Step:**  
  - First, test that saving a section title hides the edit UI.
  - Then, test that clicking **Curriculum Item** toggles the UI (check if the flag `isAddingItem` is set to true).
  - Next, test that selecting a type correctly adds a new curriculum item and that its UI appears for editing.
  - Finally, test that clicking “Add” on the curriculum item saves the data (i.e., sets `isEditingItem` to false).

### **Step 7. Reflect on What You Learned**

- **State Management:**  
  How does adding a new flag in your state help you control which parts of the UI are visible?
  
- **Event Handling:**  
  Why is it important to use an arrow function in the `onClick` prop (e.g., `onClick={() => toggleAddingItem(section.id, true)}`) rather than calling a function directly?

- **Conditional Rendering:**  
  How does React’s ability to conditionally render JSX help you build dynamic interfaces like this one?

---

### **Final Thoughts**

- **Experiment:**  
  Try implementing these steps incrementally. For instance, first add the state flag and log its value. Then, modify your UI to show different content based on that flag.

- **Documentation and Resources:**  
  Consider reading about conditional rendering in the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) and state management with hooks.

- **Challenge Yourself:**  
  Once you have the basics working, try adding a new feature: what if you want to allow editing the curriculum item type after it has been added? How might you do that?

By breaking the problem down into these steps, you’re not only solving this particular issue but also building a process for tackling future problems. Keep experimenting and exploring—every challenge is an opportunity to learn more about how React works.

Happy coding!
